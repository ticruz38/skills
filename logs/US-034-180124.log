│ **Docker/Container Management:**                                             │
│ - **NEVER** run `docker stop` without an explicit container name or ID       │
│ - **NEVER** use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` or any pattern that stops mult │
│ iple/all containers                                                          │

│ **Process Management:**                                                      │
│ - **NEVER** run `killall`, `pkill`, or similar commands without specific pro │

│ **Port/Network Conflicts:**                                                  │
│ - If a port is in use, **USE A DIFFERENT PORT** instead of killing the proce │
│ ss using it                                                                  │
│ - Check what's running on a port with `lsof -i :<port>` or `ss -tlnp | grep  │
│ <port>`                                                                      │

│ ## Your Task                                                                 │

│ 1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)           │
│ 2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section  │
│ first)                                                                       │
│ 3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check i │
│ t out or create from main.                                                   │
│ 4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`            │
│ 5. Implement that single user story                                          │
│ 6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your proje │
│ ct requires)                                                                 │
│ 7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)      │
│ 8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Sto │
│ ry Title]`                                                                   │
│ 9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story              │
│ 10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`                                   │
│                                                                              │

│ APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):                       │
│ ```                                                                          │
│ ## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]                                                  │

│ - **Learnings for future iterations:**                                       │
│   - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")                 │
│   - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")   │
│   - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")          │

│ The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeati │
│ ng mistakes and understand the codebase better.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Consolidate Patterns                                                      │

│ If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, a │
│ dd it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (crea │
│ te it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most importa │
│ nt learnings:                                                                │

│ ## Codebase Patterns                                                         │
│ - Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations                       │
│ - Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations                         │
│ - Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components                    │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific deta │
│ ils.                                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Update AGENTS.md Files                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving │
│ in nearby AGENTS.md files:                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories yo │
│ u modified                                                                   │
│ 2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directorie │
│ s or parent directories                                                      │
│ 3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developer │
│ s/agents should know:                                                        │
│    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module                     │
│    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements                                     │
│    - Dependencies between files                                              │
│    - Testing approaches for that area                                        │
│    - Configuration or environment requirements                               │
│                                                                              │
│ **Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**                                    │
│ - "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"                     │
│ - "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"                             │
│ - "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"                        │
│ - "Field names must match the template exactly"                              │
│                                                                              │
│ **Do NOT add:**                                                              │
│ - Story-specific implementation details                                      │
│ - Temporary debugging notes                                                  │
│ - Information already in progress.txt                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that woul │
│ d help future work in that directory.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Quality Requirements                                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ - ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test │
│ )                                                                            │
│ - Do NOT commit broken code                                                  │
│ - Keep changes focused and minimal                                           │
│ - Follow existing code patterns                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)                           │
│                                                                              │
│ For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:      │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. Load the `dev-browser` skill                                              │
│ 2. Navigate to the relevant page                                             │
│ 3. Verify the UI changes work as expected                                    │
│ 4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log                         │
│                                                                              │
│ A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.          │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Stop Condition                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.     │

• Let me understand the task. I'm an autonomous coding agent working on a softwa
  re project. I need to:

  1. Read the PRD at prd.json
  2. Read the progress log at progress.txt (check Codebase Patterns section firs
  3. Check I'm on the correct branch from PRD branchName
  4. Pick the highest priority user story where passes: false
  5. Implement that single user story
  6. Run quality checks
  7. Update AGENTS.md files if needed
  8. Commit changes
  9. Update PRD to set passes: true
  10. Append progress to progress.txt

  Let me start by reading the PRD and progress files.
• I'll start by reading the PRD and progress files to understand what needs to b
  e done.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file to see the rest of the content.
• Let me continue reading the progress file:
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• I have successfully processed the prd.json file and cross-referenced it with t
  he existing progress.txt. The data confirms that the first 33 user stories are
  finished. My next objective is to tackle the first pending story: US-034: Crea
  te draft-responses skill for email replies.

  This story requires generating email reply suggestions with features like tone
  selection, context-awareness, and templates. It also specifically notes a depe
  ndency on the email skill and requires a passing typecheck.

  Hmm, before I start writing code for US-034, I need to ensure my development e
  nvironment is correctly aligned with the project state. I see a branchName spe
  cified in the PRD. It's crucial to verify if I'm on the correct branch to main
  tain the workflow consistency described in the instructions. If I'm not on the
  right branch, any new features I implement might be misplaced or cause integra
  tion issues later.

  Wait, I should also check if the branch actually exists or if I need to create
  it based on the main branch. The instructions mention checking out or creating
  the branch if I'm not already on it.

  Actually, let me first check the current git status and the latest commit logs
  . This will give me a clear picture of where I am in the repository's history
  and whether the current branch matches the ralph/all-skills target. Once I hav
  e this context, I'll know exactly how to proceed with the branch management be
  fore moving into the skills/ directory to implement the email reply logic.
• Now I understand the project. Looking at the PRD, I need to find the first sto
  ry with passes: false. Let me check the current branch and implement US-034 (d
  raft-responses skill).
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...s && git log --oneline -3)
• I'm on the correct branch ralph/all-skills. Now I need to implement US-034: Cr
  eate draft-responses skill for email replies.

  Let me look at the existing skills directory structure to understand the patte
  rns used.
• Good, I'm on the correct branch. Now let me check the existing skills structur
  e and the email skill (which draft-responses depends on):
• Used Shell (ls -la /root/code/skills/skills/ | head -40)
• Used Glob (skills/email/src/*.ts)
• I have the requirements for the draft-responses skill. It needs to generate em
  ail replies, support multiple tones, and integrate with the email skill for re
  ading messages and sending.

  Hmm, before I start coding the logic for natural language parsing or the CLI,
  I need to understand the established project structure. If I want the "one-cli
  ck send" feature to work seamlessly, I must see how the email skill handles me
  ssage threads and sending commands.

  Actually, instead of guessing, I should look at the existing skill templates.
  The engagement-replies and summarizer skills were recently implemented, so the
  y likely follow the current best practices for the codebase, especially regard
  ing AI-driven output and CLI design.

  By reviewing these files—the SKILL.md for interface contracts, index.ts for co
  re logic, and cli.ts for user interaction—I can ensure the new skill is consis
  tent with the rest of the system. This will clarify how to structure the depen
  dencies and the specific methods required for the "context-aware drafting" men
  tioned in the PRD.
• Let me read the email skill interface and a similar skill (engagement-replies)
  for patterns:
• Used ReadFile (skills/email/SKILL.md)
• Used ReadFile (skills/engagement-replies/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/engagement-replies/src/cli.ts)
• I have a solid grasp of the requirements for the draft-responses skill. It nee
  ds to support multiple tones like 'professional' and 'casual', generate contex
  t-aware drafts, and handle one-click sending via the email skill. I've already
  looked at the engagement-replies skill for inspiration, but to build this corr
  ectly, I need to understand the internal structure of the email skill I'm exte
  nding.

  Hmm, I need to know the exact method signatures for the email skill's send and
  getThread functions. Are they synchronous or async? Do they return a standard
  promise structure? Without this, the 'one-click send' feature might fail at th
  e integration stage.

  Wait, before I start writing the index.ts or cli.ts files for draft-responses,
  I also need to ensure the project configuration is perfect. I'll need a packag
  e.json to handle the dependency on the local email skill and a tsconfig.json t
  hat matches the existing codebase's strictness. It's better to check an existi
  ng, similar skill's configuration rather than guessing. The inbox-triage skill
  seems like a perfect reference for a TypeScript-based skill that likely intera
  cts with the same underlying systems.

  Actually, let me look at the email skill's source first to get those API detai
  ls right. Then, I'll check the inbox-triage skill's setup files. This will pro
  vide the necessary blueprint for the package.json and tsconfig.json I need to
  create. This approach ensures I don't miss any critical compiler settings or d
  ependency mappings required for this specific ecosystem. Once I have these ref
  erences, I can proceed with the actual implementation.
• Now I understand the patterns. Let me also check the email skill's index.ts to
  understand how to integrate:
• Used ReadFile (skills/email/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/inbox-triage/package.json)
• Used ReadFile (skills/inbox-triage/tsconfig.json)
• I've analyzed the requirements for the draft-responses skill. It needs to prov
  ide context-aware reply suggestions and integrate with the existing email skil
  l for one-click sending. Hmm, I should ensure the tone selection—professional,
  casual, friendly, formal—is robust enough to handle various email contexts. Ac
  tually, the integration with the email skill is the most critical part; I need
  to make sure the handoff for the "one-click send" is seamless. Before I dive i
  nto the code, I need to establish the skill's foundation. I'll start by settin
  g up the directory structure and the essential configuration files like packag
  e.json and tsconfig.json. This will allow me to then proceed with writing the
  core logic and CLI interface. Let's initialize the workspace.
• Now I have a good understanding. Let me create the draft-responses skill:
• Used Shell (mkdir -p /root/code/skill...kills/draft-responses/src)
• Now I'll create the skill files.
• Used WriteFile (skills/draft-responses/package.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/draft-responses/tsconfig.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/draft-responses/.gitignore)
• I have successfully identified the patterns from the engagement-replies and in
  box-triage skills. The architecture for this new skill is now clear: it must b
  ridge the gap between the email client and the AI's response generation capabi
  lities. The core will be the DraftResponsesSkill class, which needs to manage
  its own SQLite state for drafts and interface with the EmailSkill for message
  context.

  Hmm, I should pay special attention to the "context-aware" requirement. This m
  eans the skill shouldn't just look at the immediate email; it should ideally l
  ook at the threadId to understand the historical back-and-forth. This will all
  ow the model to provide much more relevant and coherent suggestions. I also ne
  ed to implement the Tone system—professional, casual, friendly, formal—ensurin
  g the generated text matches the user's intent.

  Wait, I also need to handle the "One-click send" functionality. This implies t
  hat after a draft is generated and stored, there should be a straightforward m
  ethod to pass that draft back to the EmailSkill for delivery. I will define th
  e DraftSuggestion and Template interfaces to standardize this data flow.

  Actually, before building the CLI, I need the core library ready. It needs met
  hods for generateDrafts, getThreadContext, and sendDraft. Using sqlite3, I'll
  set up the schema to store these suggestions persistently. This is more robust
  than keeping them in memory, especially if the agent is restarted.

  The src/index.ts file will house this logic. I'll implement the runWithResult
  helper for SQLite and the main class definition. This foundational file is cri
  tical for the skill's operation. Once this is written, I can move on to the CL
  I interface. Let me proceed with creating the implementation in skills/draft-r
  esponses/src/index.ts.
• Now let me create the main index.ts file with the draft-responses skill implem
  entation:
• Used WriteFile (skills/draft-responses/src/index.ts)
• Now let me create the CLI file.
• Now let me create the CLI file:
• Used WriteFile (skills/draft-responses/src/cli.ts)
• Now let me create the SKILL.md file with documentation.
• Now let me create the SKILL.md documentation:
• Used WriteFile (skills/draft-responses/SKILL.md)
• Now let me install dependencies and build the skill to verify it type-checks.
• Now let me install dependencies and build the skill:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...onses && npm install 2>&1)
• Good, dependencies are installed. Now let me run the typecheck to make sure ev
  erything compiles correctly.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Typecheck passes! Now let me build the project.
• Typecheck passes. Now let me build the project:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...ses && npm run build 2>&1)
• The build is successful. Now let me verify everything works by testing the CLI
  help and health check.
• Let me verify the build and test the CLI:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil... && node dist/cli.js help)
• The CLI works. Let me also test the tones command.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& node dist/cli.js tones)
• Excellent! Now let me test the templates command.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...ode dist/cli.js templates)
• Excellent! The skill is working. Now let me test the template application:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil... help with the project"}')
• The skill is working correctly. Now let me commit the changes and update the P
  RD and progress.txt.
• The skill is working correctly. Now let me add the files to git and commit:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...-responses/ && git status)
• I should add the package-lock.json to gitignore and remove it from staging sin
  ce that's the pattern I see in other skills. Let me check what the other skill
  s do.
• Let me check if other skills track package-lock.json:
• Used Shell (ls /root/code/skills/skil...s/skills/email/.gitignore)
• I see that the other skills include package-lock.json in their .gitignore. Let
  me update the .gitignore to include it and reset the staging.
• Let me update the .gitignore to exclude package-lock.json:
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/draft-responses/.gitignore)
• Now let me reset the staging and re-add the files excluding package-lock.json.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...-responses/ && git status)
• Good. Now let me commit the changes.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g... skill for email replies")
• The commit was successful. Now let me update the PRD to set passes: true for U
  S-034.
• Now let me update the PRD to mark US-034 as complete:
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
• Now let me append the progress to progress.txt.
• Now let me append the progress to progress.txt:
• Used Shell (cat >> /root/code/skills/...ng and statistics --- EOF)
• Let me verify the PRD update and check if there are any other stories with pas
  ses: false that need to be implemented.
• Let me verify the PRD was updated correctly:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...'"id": "US-034"' prd.json)
• Let me check if there are more stories that need to be done.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g..."passes": false' prd.json)
• There are still 26 stories with passes: false. Let me check what the next one
  is.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...alse' prd.json | head -30)
• US-034 is done. The next story is US-035 (gift-suggestions), but there are 26
  more stories that need to be completed.

  Let me verify the skill is complete by checking a final summary.
• Let me verify the final state:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g... echo "stories remaining")
• The current user story has been successfully implemented and verified. I have
  created the draft-responses skill, ensuring it integrates properly with the ex
  isting email skill to provide context-aware suggestions. Hmm, let me re-verify
  the acceptance criteria one last time. Multiple tone options? Yes, the logic s
  upports various tones. One-click send? Handled. Template support? Implemented.
  Typecheck? Passed.

  Everything seems to be in order for this specific story. But wait, I need to s
  tep back and look at the broader roadmap before finishing. The PRD lists 60 st
  ories in total. I've updated this one to passes: true, but I haven't verified
  the overall completion status of the project requirements lately.

  Actually, to be absolutely sure about the current state, I should check the pr
  d.json file directly. I need to see exactly how many stories are marked as pas
  ses: true versus passes: false. This will give me a clear indication of whethe
  r I'm finished with this task or if there are remaining stories to address. I'
  ll run a count on both statuses now to get the final numbers.
• I've completed US-034: Create draft-responses skill for email replies.
