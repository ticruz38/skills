│ **Docker/Container Management:**                                             │
│ - **NEVER** run `docker stop` without an explicit container name or ID       │
│ - **NEVER** use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` or any pattern that stops mult │
│ iple/all containers                                                          │

│ **Process Management:**                                                      │
│ - **NEVER** run `killall`, `pkill`, or similar commands without specific pro │

│ **Port/Network Conflicts:**                                                  │
│ - If a port is in use, **USE A DIFFERENT PORT** instead of killing the proce │
│ ss using it                                                                  │
│ - Check what's running on a port with `lsof -i :<port>` or `ss -tlnp | grep  │
│ <port>`                                                                      │

│ ## Your Task                                                                 │

│ 1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)           │
│ 2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section  │
│ first)                                                                       │
│ 3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check i │
│ t out or create from main.                                                   │
│ 4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`            │
│ 5. Implement that single user story                                          │
│ 6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your proje │
│ ct requires)                                                                 │
│ 7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)      │
│ 8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Sto │
│ ry Title]`                                                                   │
│ 9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story              │
│ 10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`                                   │
│                                                                              │

│ APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):                       │
│ ```                                                                          │
│ ## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]                                                  │

│ - **Learnings for future iterations:**                                       │
│   - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")                 │
│   - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")   │
│   - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")          │

│ The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeati │
│ ng mistakes and understand the codebase better.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Consolidate Patterns                                                      │

│ If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, a │
│ dd it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (crea │
│ te it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most importa │
│ nt learnings:                                                                │

│ ## Codebase Patterns                                                         │
│ - Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations                       │
│ - Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations                         │
│ - Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components                    │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific deta │
│ ils.                                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Update AGENTS.md Files                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving │
│ in nearby AGENTS.md files:                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories yo │
│ u modified                                                                   │
│ 2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directorie │
│ s or parent directories                                                      │
│ 3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developer │
│ s/agents should know:                                                        │
│    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module                     │
│    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements                                     │
│    - Dependencies between files                                              │
│    - Testing approaches for that area                                        │
│    - Configuration or environment requirements                               │
│                                                                              │
│ **Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**                                    │
│ - "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"                     │
│ - "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"                             │
│ - "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"                        │
│ - "Field names must match the template exactly"                              │
│                                                                              │
│ **Do NOT add:**                                                              │
│ - Story-specific implementation details                                      │
│ - Temporary debugging notes                                                  │
│ - Information already in progress.txt                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that woul │
│ d help future work in that directory.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Quality Requirements                                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ - ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test │
│ )                                                                            │
│ - Do NOT commit broken code                                                  │
│ - Keep changes focused and minimal                                           │
│ - Follow existing code patterns                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)                           │
│                                                                              │
│ For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:      │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. Load the `dev-browser` skill                                              │
│ 2. Navigate to the relevant page                                             │
│ 3. Verify the UI changes work as expected                                    │
│ 4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log                         │
│                                                                              │
│ A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.          │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Stop Condition                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.     │

• The user wants me to work as a Ralph autonomous coding agent. Let me start by
  reading the PRD and progress log to understand what needs to be done.

  1. First, I'll read the prd.json file
  2. Then read progress.txt to check Codebase Patterns
  3. Check the branch and implement the highest priority user story with passes:
     lse
  4. Run quality checks
  5. Commit and update progress

  Let me start by reading the PRD and progress files.
• I'll start by reading the PRD and progress log to understand what needs to be
  implemented.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file to see the remaining entries and
  find the Codebase Patterns section.
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt to see more recent entries and check
  the current branch:
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used Shell (git branch --show-current && git status --short)
• I've identified the remaining tasks: US-052 through US-060. These cover a wide
  range of functionalities, including financial reporting, automated monitoring,
  and calendar management. Specifically, US-056 (showing-scheduler) stands out a
  s a critical component for the real estate vertical, requiring integration wit
  h both the calendar and client-crm modules.

  Hmm, I notice I've already read the relevant sections in progress.txt up to li
  ne 1999. But wait, checking the file size, there's definitely more content bel
  ow that isn't currently visible in my context. Before I dive into implementati
  on for US-052, I need to see if any recent commits or manual logs in the progr
  ess file provide specific architectural constraints for these remaining storie
  s.

  Actually, if the real estate features like US-056 depend on previous work, I s
  hould verify the current state of the skills/ directory first. I'll examine th
  e bottom of the progress log for the latest updates and then list the existing
  skills to ensure I don't duplicate logic or miss a dependency. This will give
  me a clear baseline before I start modifying the codebase.
• Let me read the remaining progress.txt and check the skills directory:
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used Shell (ls -la skills/ | head -60)
• I have successfully reviewed the progress logs. The implementation of US-051 i
  s complete, and I am now up to speed on the requirements for the remaining use
  r stories. Looking at the PRD, I see that US-052 (report-builder) is the next
  logical step in the sequence. This skill is designed to automate data reports
  by pulling information from the data-connector and utilizing the chart-generat
  or for visualization, which is a critical integration point for the platform.

  However, to implement US-052 effectively, I need to generate a consistent inte
  rnal dataset that can be used to test the reporting logic. While I have the sp
  ecifications for the report-builder itself, I need to verify the exact configu
  ration and structure of the datasets that were used in the preceding stories t
  o ensure continuity.

  Wait... before I dive into the code for US-052, I must ensure my understanding
  of the test data environment is accurate. The files in skills/data-connector/
  and skills/chart-generator/ likely contain the specific schemas and sample dat
  a references I need. By reading the SKILL.md files and any relevant source cod
  e like src/index.ts from these directories, I can confirm how the data is bein
  g ingested and transformed. This will allow me to build the report-builder on
  a solid foundation that aligns with the existing components.

  I will proceed by examining the documentation and entry points for both the da
  ta-connector and chart-generator skills. This will provide the necessary techn
  ical context for the data structures I need to report on.
• I'm on the correct branch ralph/all-skills. Looking at the PRD, the remaining
  stories with passes: false are US-052 through US-060. The highest priority rem
  aining is US-052: Create report-builder skill for automated reports.

  Let me check the dependencies to understand the existing patterns:
• Used ReadFile (skills/data-connector/SKILL.md)
• Used ReadFile (skills/chart-generator/SKILL.md)
• Used ReadFile (skills/email/src/index.ts)
• I've analyzed the dependencies for US-052: the report-builder skill is a meta-
  skill that orchestrates data-connector, chart-generator, and email. Now I need
  to plan the implementation.

  Hmm, how should the data flow work? The user wants scheduled reports. This imp
  lies a persistent state to store the 'schedule' configuration—likely in a loca
  l database or a JSON file. I also need to consider the aggregation logic and h
  ow to pass that data to the chart generator.

  Wait, I should check the existing codebase patterns first. Does the project us
  e a specific directory structure for skills? Looking at the skills/ folder, it
  seems each skill is a self-contained module.

  Actually, I'll start by creating the report-builder directory and a package.js
  on file. This will define the skill's metadata and its dependencies on the oth
  er local skill packages. Before I dive into the TypeScript implementation of t
  he scheduler and aggregator, I need to see how the other skills are structured
  to maintain consistency.

  Let me look at one of the simpler skills to understand the file structure and
  build patterns. I'll check skills/focus-time-blocks. This should give me a cle
  ar template for the src/index.ts entry point and the CLI setup.
• Now I understand the requirements for US-052. The report-builder skill depends
  on data-connector, chart-generator, and email. It needs to:

  • Build automated data reports
  • Scheduled reports with templates
  • Data aggregation
  • PDF/Excel export
  • Email delivery

  Let me create the skill:
• Used Shell (mkdir -p skills/report-bu...config.json, .gitignore" )
• Now let me create the main library file (index.ts) for the report-builder skil
  l.
• Used WriteFile (skills/report-builder/src/index.ts)
• Now let me create the CLI file for the report-builder skill.
• Now let me create the CLI file:
• Used WriteFile (skills/report-builder/src/cli.ts)
• Now let me create the SKILL.md documentation file.
• Now let me create the SKILL.md documentation:
• Used WriteFile (skills/report-builder/SKILL.md)
• Now let me install dependencies and run typecheck to make sure everything comp
  iles correctly.
• Now let me install dependencies and run typecheck:
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder && npm install 2>&1)
• Dependencies installed. Now let me run typecheck to make sure the code compile
  s.
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder && npm run typecheck 2>&1)
  Failed with exit code: 2
• There's a type error on line 721. Let me check and fix it.
• Let me fix the type error:
• Used ReadFile (skills/report-builder/src/index.ts)
• Hmm, the TypeScript compiler is flagging line 721. It seems template.valueColu
  mn is typed as string | undefined, but reportData.headers.indexOf() strictly e
  xpects a string.

  Wait, I added a check for template.valueColumn on line 717, so logically it sh
  ould be defined within that block. But TypeScript's static analysis doesn't na
  rrow the type across the complex conditional or within the nested map function
  call.

  Actually, to resolve this without changing the logic, I should use a non-null
  assertion. Since I've confirmed valueColumn is required for this branch to exe
  cute, casting it as string is the most direct fix. I'll modify line 721 to ens
  ure the type is handled correctly during the index lookup.
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/report-builder/src/index.ts)
• Now let me run typecheck again.
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder && npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Typecheck passes. Now let me also run the build to make sure everything compil
  es correctly.
• Typecheck passes. Let me run the build and test the CLI:
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder && npm run build 2>&1)
• Build successful. Now let me test the CLI by running the health check.
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder && npm run status 2>&1)
• The skill is working. The status shows degraded because data-connector and ema
  il dependencies aren't configured, but the core functionality works. The chart
  -generator shows as working since it has no external dependencies.

  Now let me also test creating a template and listing templates:
• Let me test a few more CLI commands:
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder ...cli -- template-list 2>&1)
• Good, the CLI is working. Now let me also test the stats command:
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder ...npm run cli -- stats 2>&1)
• I see a small issue with the stats - there's a "null enabled" showing because
  the database returns null for sum when there are no rows. This is a minor disp
  lay issue but I should fix it. Let me update the stats display in the CLI.

  Actually, this is just a display issue in the CLI. The core functionality work
  s. Let me fix this:
• Let me fix the stats display issue:
• Used ReadFile (skills/report-builder/src/cli.ts)
• Let me find the stats section in the CLI.
• Used Grep (case 'stats':)
• The issue is that when the database returns null for the enabled count and his
  tory counts (because there are no rows), it displays as "null" instead of "0".
  Let me fix this in the index.ts to ensure we always return numbers.
• Used ReadFile (skills/report-builder/src/index.ts)
• Let me find the getStats method in the index.ts.
• Used Grep (async getStats)
• I see the issue. When the SUM returns NULL (because there are no rows), it pas
  ses through as null. I need to handle null values by converting them to 0. Let
  me fix this.
• Let me fix the null handling in the getStats method:
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/report-builder/src/index.ts)
• Now let me rebuild and test again.
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder ...npm run cli -- stats 2>&1)
• Now the stats display correctly with 0 instead of null. Let me also verify the
  typecheck still passes and then update the PRD and progress log.
• Now let me run typecheck one more time, then update the PRD and commit:
• Used Shell (cd skills/report-builder && npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Typecheck passes. Now let me update the PRD to mark US-052 as passing, and add
  to the progress log.
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
  No replacements made
• Let me check the exact format in the prd.json file for US-052.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• I see, the format is different than expected. Let me fix the replacement.
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
  No replacements made
• Let me try a different approach - just replace the specific line.
• Used Shell (sed -i 's/"id": "US-052"/...rying different approach")
• Actually, let me use a simpler approach with line number-based replacement.
• Used Shell (sed -n '817,819p' prd.json)
• Line 818 has the "passes": false that I need to change. Let me use sed to repl
  ace that specific line.
• Used Shell (sed -i '818s/"passes": fa...ed -n '815,822p' prd.json)
• Hmm, the sed command didn't work as expected. Let me try a different approach
  with a simpler replacement.
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
  No replacements made
• Let me try to read the exact bytes from the file.
• Used Shell (cat -A prd.json | sed -n '817,820p')
• Let me try a simple Python script to update the JSON file.
• Used Shell (node -e " const fs = requ...('US-052 not found'); } ")
  Failed with exit code: 1
• It looks like the prd.json file might be corrupted. Let me check what happened
  .
• Used Shell (sed -n '800,810p' prd.json)
• Oh no! My earlier sed command corrupted the file. Let me fix it by restoring t
  he proper structure.
• Used Shell (git checkout prd.json && ...ed -n '805,825p' prd.json)
• Good, the file is restored. Now let me update it correctly using a proper Pyth
  on script.
• Used Shell (python3 << 'EOF' import j...('\n') print('Done') EOF )
• Now let me verify the change and then append to progress.txt.
• Used Shell (grep -A 2 '"id": "US-052"' prd.json)
• Let me also check the passes field was updated.
• Used Shell (grep -A 12 '"id": "US-052"' prd.json | tail -5)
• The PRD is updated. Now let me append the progress report to progress.txt.
• Now let me append the progress report:
• Used Shell (cat >> progress.txt << 'E...echo "Progress appended" )
• Now let me commit all changes.
• Now let me commit the changes:
• Used Shell (git add -A && git status)
• Good, all files are staged. Let me commit with the proper message.
• Used Shell (git commit -m "feat: US-0... echo "Commit successful")
• The commit was successful. Now let me check if there are more stories to compl
  ete. Looking at the PRD, the remaining stories with passes: false are:

  • US-053: Create monthly-reports skill for expenses
  • US-054: Create competitor-monitor skill for tracking
  • US-055: Create email-summarizer skill for thread summaries
  • US-056: Create showing-scheduler skill for real estate
  • US-057: Create pantry-tracker skill for inventory
  • US-058: Create diy-guides skill for home repairs
  • US-059: Create review-monitor skill for reputation
  • US-060: Create saved-searches skill for research automation

  Since there are still stories with passes: false, I should end my response nor
  mally and let the next iteration continue with US-053.
• I've completed US-052: Create report-builder skill for automated reports. Here
  's a summary:
