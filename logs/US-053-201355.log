│ **Docker/Container Management:**                                             │
│ - **NEVER** run `docker stop` without an explicit container name or ID       │
│ - **NEVER** use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` or any pattern that stops mult │
│ iple/all containers                                                          │

│ **Process Management:**                                                      │
│ - **NEVER** run `killall`, `pkill`, or similar commands without specific pro │

│ **Port/Network Conflicts:**                                                  │
│ - If a port is in use, **USE A DIFFERENT PORT** instead of killing the proce │
│ ss using it                                                                  │
│ - Check what's running on a port with `lsof -i :<port>` or `ss -tlnp | grep  │
│ <port>`                                                                      │

│ ## Your Task                                                                 │

│ 1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)           │
│ 2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section  │
│ first)                                                                       │
│ 3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check i │
│ t out or create from main.                                                   │
│ 4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`            │
│ 5. Implement that single user story                                          │
│ 6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your proje │
│ ct requires)                                                                 │
│ 7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)      │
│ 8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Sto │
│ ry Title]`                                                                   │
│ 9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story              │
│ 10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`                                   │
│                                                                              │

│ APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):                       │
│ ```                                                                          │
│ ## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]                                                  │

│ - **Learnings for future iterations:**                                       │
│   - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")                 │
│   - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")   │
│   - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")          │

│ The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeati │
│ ng mistakes and understand the codebase better.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Consolidate Patterns                                                      │

│ If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, a │
│ dd it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (crea │
│ te it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most importa │
│ nt learnings:                                                                │

│ ## Codebase Patterns                                                         │
│ - Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations                       │
│ - Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations                         │
│ - Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components                    │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific deta │
│ ils.                                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Update AGENTS.md Files                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving │
│ in nearby AGENTS.md files:                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories yo │
│ u modified                                                                   │
│ 2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directorie │
│ s or parent directories                                                      │
│ 3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developer │
│ s/agents should know:                                                        │
│    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module                     │
│    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements                                     │
│    - Dependencies between files                                              │
│    - Testing approaches for that area                                        │
│    - Configuration or environment requirements                               │
│                                                                              │
│ **Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**                                    │
│ - "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"                     │
│ - "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"                             │
│ - "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"                        │
│ - "Field names must match the template exactly"                              │
│                                                                              │
│ **Do NOT add:**                                                              │
│ - Story-specific implementation details                                      │
│ - Temporary debugging notes                                                  │
│ - Information already in progress.txt                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that woul │
│ d help future work in that directory.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Quality Requirements                                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ - ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test │
│ )                                                                            │
│ - Do NOT commit broken code                                                  │
│ - Keep changes focused and minimal                                           │
│ - Follow existing code patterns                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)                           │
│                                                                              │
│ For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:      │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. Load the `dev-browser` skill                                              │
│ 2. Navigate to the relevant page                                             │
│ 3. Verify the UI changes work as expected                                    │
│ 4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log                         │
│                                                                              │
│ A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.          │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Stop Condition                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.     │

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
• Let me start by reading the PRD file and the progress log to understand what n
  eeds to be done.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file to see more patterns and learnin
  gs.
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && git branch)
• I have identified the next set of skills to implement by analyzing the PRD and
  the current progress. The priority list now points to US-053 (monthly-reports)
  as the immediate next task. Actually, looking at the dependency graph, this sk
  ill builds directly on the expense-categorizer logic established in previous s
  prints.

  Wait... before I dive into the code, I need to be sure about the current repos
  itory state. I see a lot of activity in the logs, but I need to know exactly w
  hich files are already present in the skills/ directory. This will prevent any
  redundant work and help me understand if there are any shared utilities I shou
  ld be leveraging for the report generation logic.

  Furthermore, checking the ralph/ directory is essential as it likely contains
  the core engine or templates for skill generation. If the goal is 'monthly-rep
  orts', there might already be a scaffold or a reporting utility hidden in ther
  e that I should adhere to rather than reinventing.

  Instead of guessing based on the previous logs, I'll perform a quick scan. Lis
  ting the contents of both skills/ and ralph/ will provide the necessary archit
  ectural context. This step ensures that when I do start the implementation, I'
  m building on top of the existing foundation rather than creating a parallel s
  tructure. Let's verify the file system state first.
• Let me continue reading the progress to understand the current state and then
  check what needs to be implemented.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && ls -la skills/ | head -60)
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && ls -la ralph/)
• I've identified that monthly-reports is currently at passes: false in the proj
  ect requirements. The task is to provide monthly expense summaries, which clea
  rly depends on the expense-categorizer for the raw data. However, before I can
  start defining the logic for spending breakdowns or trend analysis, I need to
  establish a clear picture of the current project state.

  Hmm, I see skills/expense-categorizer/ exists, but is it actually populated wi
  th the necessary exports? I can't assume the previous steps were fully complet
  ed just because the directory is there. If the categorizer's interface is miss
  ing or incomplete, my reporting module will have nothing to build upon.

  Wait, I should also verify if there are any other reporting-related modules al
  ready in place. It’s possible some utilities for data aggregation or chart gen
  eration are already sitting in the skills/ folder. Jumping straight into codin
  g the monthly-reports logic without this context could lead to redundant work
  or architectural mismatches.

  Actually, a quick inspection of both the categorizer and the broader skills di
  rectory is the most logical next step. This will reveal the available API surf
  ace and help me determine the best integration path for the new reporting feat
  ures. I'll check the expense categorizer's source first, then list the other s
  kill directories to see what's ready to use.
• Let me check the current state of expense-categorizer and look at an existing
  skill for reference.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && l.../expense-categorizer/src/)
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && l...review|saved)" | head -20)
• I've analyzed the current skills/ directory and cross-referenced it with the p
  roject PRD. It's clear that while the foundation is there with expense-categor
  izer, the actual reporting layer—monthly-reports—hasn't been started yet. Hmm,
  I should double-check the priority list again.

  Wait, looking closely at the PRD, US-053 is indeed the highest priority item w
  here passes is still set to false. This is the core requirement for delivering
  spending breakdowns and trend analysis. Everything else seems to be either com
  pleted or dependent on this reporting capability being functional first.

  Actually, before I dive into the implementation of src/index.ts and src/cli.ts
  , I need to establish a proper roadmap. If I just start coding, I might lose t
  rack of the specific requirements like visual charts or PDF export mentioned i
  n the user story. The best approach is to initialize a todo list specifically
  for US-053. This will allow me to track the initial setup, the logic integrati
  on with the categorizer, and the final quality checks in a structured way. Let
  's get the plan in place.
• Now I understand. I need to implement the monthly-reports skill (US-053). Let
  me set up my todo list and start working on it.
• Used SetTodoList
  • Create monthly-reports skill structure (package.json, tsconfig, etc.) ←
  • Implement main library (src/index.ts)
  • Implement CLI (src/cli.ts)
  • Create SKILL.md documentation
  • Run typecheck and verify
  • Update PRD and progress.txt
• Let me look at a similar skill for reference - reports skill which also genera
  tes financial reports.
• Used ReadFile (skills/reports/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/expense-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• Let me continue reading more of the expense-categorizer skill to understand ho
  w it stores categorized expenses.
• Used ReadFile (skills/expense-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/reports/src/index.ts)
• Now I have a good understanding of the codebase patterns. Let me check the exp
  ense-categorizer more to see how it tracks categorized expenses, then create t
  he monthly-reports skill.

  The monthly-reports skill needs to:

  1. Build on top of expense-categorizer for categorized receipt data
  2. Generate monthly expense summaries with:
    • Spending breakdown by category
    • Trend analysis (month-over-month)
    • Budget comparison
    • Visual charts (ASCII or similar)
    • PDF export

  Let me create the skill now.
• Now I have a clear understanding of the patterns. Let me create the monthly-re
  ports skill. First, I'll create the directory structure and files.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && m...kills/monthly-reports/src)
• Now let me create the package.json for monthly-reports skill.
• Used WriteFile (skills/monthly-reports/package.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/monthly-reports/tsconfig.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/monthly-reports/.gitignore)
• I've completed the initial setup of the project structure. Hmm, looking back a
  t my plan, this means the foundational tasks like scaffolding the repository a
  nd setting up the configuration files are done. Now, the real work begins on t
  he data processing engine in src/index.ts. Wait, before I start coding the rep
  ort generation logic, I should update my progress tracker. I've finished the s
  etup phase, but the implementation is still pending. Actually, keeping the tod
  o list accurate prevents me from losing track of the specific requirements for
  the monthly reports. I'll update the statuses now to show that setup is finish
  ed and I'm officially moving into the implementation of the main library and t
  he CLI.
• Used SetTodoList
  • Create monthly-reports skill structure (package.json, tsconfig, etc.)
  • Implement main library (src/index.ts) ←
  • Implement CLI (src/cli.ts)

• Let me run the typecheck for the monthly-reports skill.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
  Failed with exit code: 2
• I need to check the expense-categorizer skill to see what methods are availabl
  e for getting category stats. Let me look at its full API.
• Used Grep (async (getStats|getCategoryStats|listReceipts))
• The expense-categorizer doesn't have a getCategoryStats method. Let me check w
  hat methods it has and how I can get statistics by category.
• Used ReadFile (skills/expense-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• Hmm, it seems getStats() lacks the necessary filters for date ranges and speci
  fic categories. To implement accurate monthly reporting, I need a way to calcu
  late category totals within a specific window. Wait, instead of just filtering
  receipts, I should probably build a dedicated statistics aggregation method. T
  his would make the logic cleaner and more performant. I'll update the skill's
  index file to include this new functionality. Let's modify skills/expense-cate
  gorizer/src/index.ts.
• I need to add a getCategoryStats method to the expense-categorizer skill. Let
  me update it:
• Used ReadFile (skills/expense-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• I see that the expense-categorizer doesn't have a getCategoryStats method that
  takes a category name and date range. Let me add this method to the expense-ca
  tegorizer skill before the closing brace of the class, and then I can use it i
  n monthly-reports.
• Used ReadFile (skills/expense-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• Let me find the end of the ExpenseCategorizerSkill class and add the getCatego
  ryStats method there.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && w...-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• Let me read the end of the file to find where to add the new method.
• Used ReadFile (skills/expense-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• Now I'll add a getCategoryStats method before the closing brace of the class.
  I need to insert it before line 837.
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/expense-categorizer/src/index.ts)
• Now let me run the typecheck again for the monthly-reports skill.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
  Failed with exit code: 2
• The issue is that npm is using the old cached version of the expense-categoriz
  er. I need to rebuild the dependency or use npm link. Let me check if the expe
  nse-categorizer has been compiled.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...zer && npm run build 2>&1)
• Now let me reinstall the dependencies in monthly-reports to pick up the update
  d expense-categorizer.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...dules && npm install 2>&1)
• Now let me run the typecheck again.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• The typecheck passes. Now let me update the PRD to set US-053 to passes: true
  and update the progress.txt file.
• Used SetTodoList
  • Create monthly-reports skill structure (package.json, tsconfig, etc.)
  • Implement main library (src/index.ts)
  • Implement CLI (src/cli.ts)
  • Create SKILL.md documentation

  • Update PRD and progress.txt ←
• Now let me update the PRD to mark US-053 as passing, and update the progress.t
  xt file.
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
• Now let me update the progress.txt file with the completed work.
• Used Shell (cat >> /root/code/skills/...s/progress.txt | tail -50)
• Now let me commit the changes.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && git add -A && git status)
• Let me commit the changes with the appropriate commit message.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g... skill for expenses" 2>&1)
• Now let me update the todo list and check if all stories are complete.
• Used SetTodoList

  • Implement main library (src/index.ts)
  • Implement CLI (src/cli.ts)
  • Create SKILL.md documentation
  • Run typecheck and verify
  • Update PRD and progress.txt
• Let me check if there are any remaining stories that are not complete.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g..."passes": false' prd.json)
• There are still 7 stories that haven't been completed. Let me check which ones
  they are.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...E '"id"|"title"|"passes"')
• Let me get more context from the prd.json to see which stories are not passing
  .
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && c... | grep -E '"id"|"title"')
  Failed with exit code: 1
• Let me try a different approach to find the incomplete stories.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && n...s.id + ': ' + s.title));")
• I've successfully completed US-053, which was the highest priority item remain
  ing. That leaves US-054 through US-060, but they can wait for the next cycle.
  Everything looks solid. But wait—I need to ensure the environment remains stab
  le. I should verify that the build artifacts aren't cluttering the repository
  and that all TypeScript definitions are correctly generated. Actually, before
  I finish, a quick check of the monthly-reports directory is prudent. I'll veri
  fy the source files are present and run a typecheck to guarantee the integrity
  of the code I just committed. This ensures no lingering issues were missed.
• I've completed US-053: Create monthly-reports skill for expenses.
