│ **Docker/Container Management:**                                             │
│ - **NEVER** run `docker stop` without an explicit container name or ID       │
│ - **NEVER** use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` or any pattern that stops mult │
│ iple/all containers                                                          │

│ **Process Management:**                                                      │
│ - **NEVER** run `killall`, `pkill`, or similar commands without specific pro │

│ **Port/Network Conflicts:**                                                  │
│ - If a port is in use, **USE A DIFFERENT PORT** instead of killing the proce │
│ ss using it                                                                  │
│ - Check what's running on a port with `lsof -i :<port>` or `ss -tlnp | grep  │
│ <port>`                                                                      │

│ ## Your Task                                                                 │

│ 1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)           │
│ 2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section  │
│ first)                                                                       │
│ 3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check i │
│ t out or create from main.                                                   │
│ 4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`            │
│ 5. Implement that single user story                                          │
│ 6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your proje │
│ ct requires)                                                                 │
│ 7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)      │
│ 8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Sto │
│ ry Title]`                                                                   │
│ 9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story              │
│ 10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`                                   │
│                                                                              │

│ APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):                       │
│ ```                                                                          │
│ ## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]                                                  │

│ - **Learnings for future iterations:**                                       │
│   - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")                 │
│   - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")   │
│   - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")          │

│ The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeati │
│ ng mistakes and understand the codebase better.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Consolidate Patterns                                                      │

│ If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, a │
│ dd it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (crea │
│ te it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most importa │
│ nt learnings:                                                                │

│ ## Codebase Patterns                                                         │
│ - Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations                       │
│ - Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations                         │
│ - Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components                    │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific deta │
│ ils.                                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Update AGENTS.md Files                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving │
│ in nearby AGENTS.md files:                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories yo │
│ u modified                                                                   │
│ 2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directorie │
│ s or parent directories                                                      │
│ 3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developer │
│ s/agents should know:                                                        │
│    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module                     │
│    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements                                     │
│    - Dependencies between files                                              │
│    - Testing approaches for that area                                        │
│    - Configuration or environment requirements                               │
│                                                                              │
│ **Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**                                    │
│ - "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"                     │
│ - "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"                             │
│ - "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"                        │
│ - "Field names must match the template exactly"                              │
│                                                                              │
│ **Do NOT add:**                                                              │
│ - Story-specific implementation details                                      │
│ - Temporary debugging notes                                                  │
│ - Information already in progress.txt                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that woul │
│ d help future work in that directory.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Quality Requirements                                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ - ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test │
│ )                                                                            │
│ - Do NOT commit broken code                                                  │
│ - Keep changes focused and minimal                                           │
│ - Follow existing code patterns                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)                           │
│                                                                              │
│ For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:      │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. Load the `dev-browser` skill                                              │
│ 2. Navigate to the relevant page                                             │
│ 3. Verify the UI changes work as expected                                    │
│ 4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log                         │
│                                                                              │
│ A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.          │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Stop Condition                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.     │

• Let me start by reading the PRD file and the progress log to understand what n
  eeds to be done.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used ReadFile (.last-branch)
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file since it was truncated at 1000 l
  ines.
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file to see the rest of the history a
  nd check the branch status.
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && git branch -a)
• I have analyzed the prd.json and confirmed that the project is on the ralph/al
  l-skills branch. The priority is to find the highest-priority story with "pass
  es": false.

  Scanning through the backlog:

  • US-001 to US-040 are all marked as complete ("passes": true).
  • US-041 (Create itinerary-builder skill) is the first one that is not passing
    It has a priority of 41.

  This skill requires building a tool for day-by-day travel itineraries, includi
  ng features like drag-and-drop scheduling, travel time estimation, and PDF exp
  ort. It stores data in SQLite and has no external dependencies.

  Wait, I should double-check if there are any other non-passing stories with a
  higher priority (lower number) that I might have missed. No, the list is seque
  ntial and US-041 is clearly the next item in the queue.

  Now, before I start implementation, I need to understand the project's existin
  g architecture and conventions. Looking at the file structure of previous skil
  ls will be invaluable. I'll examine a representative skill like shopping-list-
  generator to see how it handles its package.json, tsconfig.json, and source co
  de structure. This will ensure the new itinerary-builder skill is consistent w
  ith the rest of the ecosystem. I'll gather this context now before proceeding
  with the actual code changes.
• Good! I'm on the correct branch ralph/all-skills. Now let me identify the high
  est priority story with passes: false.

  Looking at the PRD, stories US-001 to US-040 are complete. The next highest pr
  iority story is US-041: Create itinerary-builder skill for trip planning with
  priority 41.

  Let me set up my todo list and explore the existing skills structure to unders
  tand the patterns.
• Used SetTodoList
  • Read existing skill patterns for reference ←
  • Create itinerary-builder skill structure (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
  • Implement core library (src/index.ts) with SQLite storage
  • Implement CLI interface (src/cli.ts)
  • Write SKILL.md documentation
  • Run typecheck and verify build
  • Update prd.json and progress.txt
  • Commit changes
• Used Shell (ls -la /root/code/skills/skills/ | head -30)
• Used ReadFile (skills/shopping-list-generator/package.json)
• Used ReadFile (skills/shopping-list-generator/tsconfig.json)
• Now I understand the pattern. Let me create the itinerary-builder skill. I'll
  start by setting up the directory structure and files.
• Let me also check a skill with PDF export capability to understand that patter
  n:
• Used Grep (PDF|pdf|export)
• Used ReadFile (skills/flight-search/src/index.ts)
• Now let me check an example of PDF export from the invoices skill, then I'll s
  tart creating the itinerary-builder skill.
• Used Grep (exportToHTML|generateHTML|exportToPDF)
• I have a good understanding of the project structure now. The task is to build
  the itinerary-builder skill, which requires specific features like drag-and-dr
  op scheduling (via CLI reordering), time estimation, and PDF export.

  Wait, I should formalize the development plan before I start writing the core
  logic. Looking at the requirements, the SQLite schema for trips and activities
  is the foundation. Hmm, if I don't map out the steps now, I might overlook the
  PDF generation or the CLI interface requirements mentioned in the specs.

  Actually, the best approach is to initialize the skill structure first. I'll n
  eed a dedicated directory for the source and a .gitignore to keep it clean. On
  ce the environment is set up, I can focus on the library implementation in src
  /index.ts.

  I'll update the todo list to reflect this sequence: initializing the structure
  , implementing the core logic, and then building out the CLI. This keeps the d
  evelopment process aligned with the acceptance criteria while ensuring I don't
  miss any functional requirements. Let's get the project skeleton ready first.
• Now I have a good understanding of the patterns. Let me create the itinerary-b
  uilder skill. I'll update my todo and start implementing.
• Used SetTodoList

  uilder skill.
• Used WriteFile (skills/itinerary-builder/package.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/itinerary-builder/tsconfig.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/itinerary-builder/.gitignore)
• Now let me create the main library file (src/index.ts) with all the itinerary
  builder functionality.
• Now let me create the main library implementation:
• Used WriteFile (skills/itinerary-builder/src/index.ts)
• Now let me create the CLI file (src/cli.ts) for the itinerary-builder skill.
• Now let me create the CLI interface:
• Used WriteFile (skills/itinerary-builder/src/cli.ts)
• Now let me create the SKILL.md documentation file.
• Now let me create the SKILL.md documentation:
• Used WriteFile (skills/itinerary-builder/SKILL.md)
• Now let me update my todo and run the typecheck to make sure everything compil
  es correctly.
• Used SetTodoList
  • Read existing skill patterns for reference

  • Commit changes
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...ilder && npm install 2>&1)
• The npm install completed (with some deprecation warnings which are expected f
  or older packages). Now let me run the typecheck to verify the TypeScript comp
  iles correctly.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
  Failed with exit code: 2
• I have a type error. The issue is with the TypeScript inference for the sqlite
  3 callback. Let me fix those lines.
• Let me fix the type errors:
• Used ReadFile (skills/itinerary-builder/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/itinerary-builder/src/index.ts)
• Hmm, the TypeScript compiler is flagging an issue with the db.all<TripRecord[]
  > calls. Let me look closer at the sqlite3 type definitions and how the generi
  c is applied.

  Wait... if db.all<T> is defined as all<T>(sql: string, ...): void;, then the g
  eneric T represents the type of a single row in the result set. By passing Tri
  pRecord[] as the generic, I'm effectively telling the compiler that the callba
  ck will receive an array of arrays. But the rows parameter in the callback is
  already the collection; it should be TripRecord[] implicitly if T is TripRecor
  d.

  Actually, that's exactly why the .map() call is failing. Since I've set T to T
  ripRecord[], the compiler thinks rows is a two-dimensional array. When I call
  .map(row => ...), it infers row as TripRecord[] instead of the expected TripRe
  cord. This explains the type mismatch.

  But wait, why didn't this show up in other skills that use similar patterns? L
  ooking at flight-search/src/index.ts... Ah, I see. It uses db.all<TripRecord>(
  ...) and the callback signature aligns with T being the element type. My usage
  in the itinerary builder is inconsistent with this pattern.

  I need to change the generic from the array type to the element type. This wil
  l align the rows parameter in the callback with the expected structure. I will
  now apply this correction to the listTrips and getActivitiesByTrip methods in
  /root/code/skills/skills/itinerary-builder/src/index.ts.
• I see the issue. The sqlite3 all method expects the single row type, not an ar
  ray type. Let me fix this:
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/itinerary-builder/src/index.ts)
• Now let me run the typecheck again to see if it's fixed.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• The typecheck passes. Now let me build the project to generate the dist files
  and then run a quick test to verify it works.
• Typecheck passes. Let me build and test the skill:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...der && npm run build 2>&1)
• The build succeeded. Let me run a quick test to verify the skill works correct
  ly.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...pm run cli -- health 2>&1)
• The skill is working. Let me do a quick functional test by creating a trip and
  adding some activities.
