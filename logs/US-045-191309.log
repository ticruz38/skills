│ **Docker/Container Management:**                                             │
│ - **NEVER** run `docker stop` without an explicit container name or ID       │
│ - **NEVER** use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` or any pattern that stops mult │
│ iple/all containers                                                          │

│ **Process Management:**                                                      │
│ - **NEVER** run `killall`, `pkill`, or similar commands without specific pro │

│ **Port/Network Conflicts:**                                                  │
│ - If a port is in use, **USE A DIFFERENT PORT** instead of killing the proce │
│ ss using it                                                                  │
│ - Check what's running on a port with `lsof -i :<port>` or `ss -tlnp | grep  │
│ <port>`                                                                      │

│ ## Your Task                                                                 │

│ 1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)           │
│ 2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section  │
│ first)                                                                       │
│ 3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check i │
│ t out or create from main.                                                   │
│ 4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`            │
│ 5. Implement that single user story                                          │
│ 6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your proje │
│ ct requires)                                                                 │
│ 7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)      │
│ 8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Sto │
│ ry Title]`                                                                   │
│ 9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story              │
│ 10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`                                   │
│                                                                              │

│ APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):                       │
│ ```                                                                          │
│ ## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]                                                  │

│ - **Learnings for future iterations:**                                       │
│   - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")                 │
│   - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")   │
│   - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")          │

│ The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeati │
│ ng mistakes and understand the codebase better.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Consolidate Patterns                                                      │

│ If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, a │
│ dd it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (crea │
│ te it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most importa │
│ nt learnings:                                                                │

│ ## Codebase Patterns                                                         │
│ - Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations                       │
│ - Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations                         │
│ - Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components                    │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific deta │
│ ils.                                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Update AGENTS.md Files                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving │
│ in nearby AGENTS.md files:                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories yo │
│ u modified                                                                   │
│ 2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directorie │
│ s or parent directories                                                      │
│ 3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developer │
│ s/agents should know:                                                        │
│    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module                     │
│    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements                                     │
│    - Dependencies between files                                              │
│    - Testing approaches for that area                                        │
│    - Configuration or environment requirements                               │
│                                                                              │
│ **Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**                                    │
│ - "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"                     │
│ - "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"                             │
│ - "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"                        │
│ - "Field names must match the template exactly"                              │
│                                                                              │
│ **Do NOT add:**                                                              │
│ - Story-specific implementation details                                      │
│ - Temporary debugging notes                                                  │
│ - Information already in progress.txt                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that woul │
│ d help future work in that directory.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Quality Requirements                                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ - ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test │
│ )                                                                            │
│ - Do NOT commit broken code                                                  │
│ - Keep changes focused and minimal                                           │
│ - Follow existing code patterns                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)                           │
│                                                                              │
│ For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:      │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. Load the `dev-browser` skill                                              │
│ 2. Navigate to the relevant page                                             │
│ 3. Verify the UI changes work as expected                                    │
│ 4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log                         │
│                                                                              │
│ A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.          │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Stop Condition                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.     │

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
• I need to implement the highest priority user story from the PRD, ensuring I f
  ollow the provided safety rules. Wait, before I start, I should establish a ba
  seline of the project's current state and identify the existing architecture.
  Looking at the file list, progress.txt likely tracks previous work, while prd.
  json and the /skills and /ralph folders will help me understand the requiremen
  ts and the current environment. By reading these key files, I can determine wh
  ich story is at the top of the backlog and how to approach the implementation.
  This is the necessary first step.
• I'll start by reading the PRD, progress log, and understanding the project str
  ucture.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used ReadFile (README.md)
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file to see all the completed stories
  and understand the codebase patterns better.
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file and check the existing skills st
  ructure:
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used Glob (skills/*)
• Used Shell (git -C /root/code/skills branch -a)
• I have analyzed the project requirements and the progress so far. We are curre
  ntly on the ralph/all-skills branch, which is correct. I have 60 skills to imp
  lement across various professional profiles. After a thorough review of the cu
  rrent project state and the PRD list, I see that the foundational authenticati
  on skills—auth-provider, google-oauth, binance-auth, quickbooks-auth, and slac
  k-auth—are already completed and marked as passing.

  However, upon closer inspection of the PRD, I noticed a gap. While the authent
  ication layers are there, the primary interface for Google Drive interactions
  is currently missing. According to the notes in the PRD for US-002, the google
  -oauth skill is intended to support Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets. I have alr
  eady implemented the email and calendar skills, but the drive skill itself—whi
  ch is the main skill for file storage, sharing, and management—is absent from
  the file list and the current progress report.

  This is a significant omission because several other features listed in the PR
  D have dependencies on it. Specifically:

  • US-017 (Receipts OCR) mentions it is "Used by: drive, photos" in its notes.
  • US-044 (Data Connector) is noted as "Required by: chart-generator" and would
    ogically rely on a drive skill for file-based data ingestion.
  • US-045 (Chart Generator) also notes it is "Used by: drive".
  • Additionally, user stories like US-055 (Email Summarizer) and US-060 (Saved
    arches) mention "Used by: drive".

  Given that google-oauth is already implemented and provides the necessary toke
  ns, the next logical and most impactful step is to create the drive skill. Thi
  s skill should provide a comprehensive wrapper around the Google Drive API, al
  lowing for file listing, uploading, downloading, sharing, and folder managemen
  t.

  Wait, I should double-check the priority. Since many other skills depend on or
  interact with Drive functionality, completing this now prevents blockers later
  in the development cycle. It fits perfectly into the existing ecosystem I've b
  een building with the other Google services. I will implement the drive skill
  as a TypeScript-based skill, following the established patterns in this reposi
  tory (like those used for calendar and email).

  Therefore, my immediate next action is to begin implementing this skill. I nee
  d to define the skill structure, including its package.json for dependencies l
  ike the Google APIs client library, a tsconfig.json for compilation, and the m
  ain implementation file. I'll start by establishing the skill's metadata and d
  ependency structure.
• I can see from the PRD and progress log that US-001 through US-044 are marked
  as passing. The next highest priority story with passes: false is US-045: Crea
  te chart-generator skill for data viz.

  Let me check the current status and look at the data-connector skill that char
  t-generator depends on:
• Used ReadFile (skills/data-connector/SKILL.md)
• Used ReadFile (skills/data-connector/src/index.ts)
• Used Glob (skills/data-connector/*)
• I've analyzed the PRD requirements for US-045. The task is to build the chart-
  generator skill, which provides data visualization capabilities. It needs to s
  upport bar, line, and pie charts, offer customization, and export to PNG/SVG.
  Crucially, it depends on the data-connector skill for its data source.

  Looking at the existing codebase, the data-connector skill provides a robust D
  ataConnectorSkill class with a getCachedData method. This is perfect for the d
  ependency requirement. For the rendering part, I need a solution that works in
  a Node.js environment without heavy external binaries. vega and vega-lite are
  ideal for this, as they allow for declarative chart definitions and can output
  both static images (via vega-canvas) and SVG.

  Wait, I should confirm the export formats. The PRD asks for PNG and SVG. vega
  handles both well. If I use vega-lite, I can simplify the specification logic,
  but I'll need to ensure the data-connector integration is seamless. I'll use f
  ast-xml-parser or a similar utility if I need to manipulate the SVG string fur
  ther, though vega usually handles the heavy lifting.

  Before I start coding, I need to organize my workflow. I have two main tasks:
  defining the skill configuration (dependencies and environment) and then imple
  menting the logic in TypeScript. I'll use the SetTodoList tool to track these.
  This ensures I don't miss the "typecheck" and "test" requirements mentioned in
  the instructions.

  The first step will be to create the package.json to define the skill's identi
  ty and its dependencies on vega, vega-lite, and fast-xml-parser. The second st
  ep will be the TypeScript implementation, which will bridge the data-connector
  data with the vega rendering engine. I'll set these up now to keep the develop
  ment process structured.
• Now I understand the data-connector skill structure. Let me create the chart-g
  enerator skill. First, let me set up the todo list and create the skill:
• Used SetTodoList
  • Create chart-generator package.json with dependencies ←
  • Create chart-generator TypeScript implementation
  • Create chart-generator CLI
  • Create chart-generator SKILL.md documentation
  • Run typecheck and verify
  • Update progress.txt and prd.json
• Used Shell (mkdir -p skills/chart-generator/src)
• Now let me look at an existing skill like charts for reference on generating c
  harts, and also look at the package.json patterns:
• Used ReadFile (skills/charts/package.json)
• Used ReadFile (skills/charts/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/data-connector/package.json)
• Hmm, I need to implement the chart-generator skill. It depends on data-connect
  or and must support bar, line, and pie charts, exporting to PNG/SVG.

  Wait, how to render charts in Node.js without a browser? Canvas-based librarie
  s like Chart.js usually require a DOM. Actually, pure SVG generation is cleane
  r for this environment. I can build SVG strings directly for bar, line, and pi
  e charts.

  The skill needs a ChartGeneratorSkill class to coordinate data fetching from d
  ata-connector and handle customization. I'll start by writing the package.json
  to define the skill and then the main index.ts with the SVG generation logic.
  This approach ensures no heavy rendering engines are needed. Let's write the f
  iles.
• Now let me create the chart-generator skill files:
• Used WriteFile (skills/chart-generator/package.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/chart-generator/tsconfig.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/chart-generator/.gitignore)
• Now let me create the main implementation file for the chart-generator skill:
• Used SetTodoList
  • Create chart-generator package.json with dependencies
  • Create chart-generator TypeScript implementation ←
  • Create chart-generator CLI
  • Create chart-generator SKILL.md documentation
  • Run typecheck and verify
  • Update progress.txt and prd.json
• Used WriteFile (skills/chart-generator/src/index.ts)
• Now let me create the CLI file for the chart-generator skill:

• The dependencies installed successfully. Now let me run typecheck to ensure th
  e TypeScript code is correct:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Typecheck passed. Now let me build the project and run a quick test to ensure
  everything works:
• Typecheck passes. Let me build and test the skill:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...tor && npm run build 2>&1)
• Build succeeded. Let me run a quick health check test:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...pm run cli -- health 2>&1)
• The skill is working. Let me test generating a simple chart:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...--title "Test Chart" 2>&1)
• Excellent! The chart was generated successfully. Let me verify the SVG file wa
  s created and check its content:
• Used Shell (ls -la /tmp/test-chart.sv...d -30 /tmp/test-chart.svg)
• The chart was generated correctly. Now let me test the template functionality:
• Let me test the template feature and then update the progress files:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...th 1000 --height 700 2>&1)
• Now let me list templates and check stats:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...npm run cli -- stats 2>&1)
• Everything is working correctly. Now let me update the progress.txt and prd.js
  on to mark US-045 as completed:
• All tests pass. Now let me update the PRD and progress log:
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
  No replacements made
• Used SetTodoList

• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• I see the exact format. Let me use the correct string replacement:
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
  No replacements made
• Let me check if there are any special characters or spaces that need to be mat
  ched exactly:
• Used Shell (grep -n '"passes": false'...kills/prd.json | head -20)
• Let me use sed to update the specific line:
• Used Shell (sed -i '712s/"passes": fa...root/code/skills/prd.json)
• Now let me also verify and check the passes field:

• Now let me commit the changes to git:
• Now let me commit the changes:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && git add -A && git status)
• Good, all the necessary files are staged. Let me commit them:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...rator skill for data viz")
