│ **Docker/Container Management:**                                             │
│ - **NEVER** run `docker stop` without an explicit container name or ID       │
│ - **NEVER** use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` or any pattern that stops mult │
│ iple/all containers                                                          │

│ **Process Management:**                                                      │
│ - **NEVER** run `killall`, `pkill`, or similar commands without specific pro │

│ **Port/Network Conflicts:**                                                  │
│ - If a port is in use, **USE A DIFFERENT PORT** instead of killing the proce │
│ ss using it                                                                  │
│ - Check what's running on a port with `lsof -i :<port>` or `ss -tlnp | grep  │
│ <port>`                                                                      │

│ ## Your Task                                                                 │

│ 1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)           │
│ 2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section  │
│ first)                                                                       │
│ 3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check i │
│ t out or create from main.                                                   │
│ 4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`            │
│ 5. Implement that single user story                                          │
│ 6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your proje │
│ ct requires)                                                                 │
│ 7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)      │
│ 8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Sto │
│ ry Title]`                                                                   │
│ 9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story              │
│ 10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`                                   │
│                                                                              │

│ APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):                       │
│ ```                                                                          │
│ ## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]                                                  │

│ - **Learnings for future iterations:**                                       │
│   - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")                 │
│   - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")   │
│   - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")          │

│ The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeati │
│ ng mistakes and understand the codebase better.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Consolidate Patterns                                                      │

│ If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, a │
│ dd it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (crea │
│ te it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most importa │
│ nt learnings:                                                                │

│ ## Codebase Patterns                                                         │
│ - Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations                       │
│ - Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations                         │
│ - Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components                    │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific deta │
│ ils.                                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Update AGENTS.md Files                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving │
│ in nearby AGENTS.md files:                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories yo │
│ u modified                                                                   │
│ 2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directorie │
│ s or parent directories                                                      │
│ 3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developer │
│ s/agents should know:                                                        │
│    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module                     │
│    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements                                     │
│    - Dependencies between files                                              │
│    - Testing approaches for that area                                        │
│    - Configuration or environment requirements                               │
│                                                                              │
│ **Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**                                    │
│ - "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"                     │
│ - "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"                             │
│ - "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"                        │
│ - "Field names must match the template exactly"                              │
│                                                                              │
│ **Do NOT add:**                                                              │
│ - Story-specific implementation details                                      │
│ - Temporary debugging notes                                                  │
│ - Information already in progress.txt                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that woul │
│ d help future work in that directory.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Quality Requirements                                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ - ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test │
│ )                                                                            │
│ - Do NOT commit broken code                                                  │
│ - Keep changes focused and minimal                                           │
│ - Follow existing code patterns                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)                           │
│                                                                              │
│ For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:      │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. Load the `dev-browser` skill                                              │
│ 2. Navigate to the relevant page                                             │
│ 3. Verify the UI changes work as expected                                    │
│ 4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log                         │
│                                                                              │
│ A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.          │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Stop Condition                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.     │

• Let me start by reading the PRD file and progress log to understand what needs
  to be done.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Let me understand the current state:

  1. I've completed US-001 through US-007 (auth-provider, google-oauth, binance-
     h, quickbooks-auth, slack-auth, email, calendar)
  2. The next story with passes: false is US-008: Create reminders skill for tas
     anagement

  Let me check the current branch and see if I need to switch to the branch spec
  ified in the PRD (ralph/all-skills).
• Let me check the current branch and look at the existing skills structure:
• Used Shell (git branch --show-current && cat .last-branch)
• Used Glob (skills/*)
• I'm on the correct branch ralph/all-skills. I see that US-008 (reminders skill
  ) has a directory already. Let me check if the skill is actually implemented a
  nd if it passes typecheck. According to the PRD, US-008 has passes: false.

  Let me look at the reminders skill to see what's there.
• Let me check the current state of the reminders skill:
• Used Glob (skills/reminders/**/*)
• Used ReadFile (skills/reminders/SKILL.md)
• I see the reminders skill exists but it's a Python implementation. According t
  o the codebase patterns in progress.txt, all skills should be TypeScript-based
  . Let me check the Python file and then create a proper TypeScript implementat
  ion.

  Looking at the acceptance criteria for US-008:

  • One-time reminders with datetime
  • Recurring reminders (daily, weekly, monthly)
  • Natural language parsing ('in 2 hours')
  • Snooze functionality
  • Mark complete/delete
  • Daemon mode for checking due reminders
  • SQLite storage
  • Typecheck passes

  I need to:

  1. Create a TypeScript implementation
  2. Add package.json, tsconfig.json
  3. Implement the CLI and library interface
  4. Make sure typecheck passes
• Let me check the existing Python implementation and then create a proper TypeS
  cript version:
• Used ReadFile (skills/reminders/reminders.py)
• Used ReadFile (skills/email/package.json)
• Used ReadFile (skills/email/tsconfig.json)
• Now I understand. The reminders skill is currently a Python implementation, bu
  t based on the patterns, I need to convert it to TypeScript. Let me create a p
  roper TypeScript implementation that follows the patterns from the other skill
  s like email and calendar.

  I need to:

  1. Create package.json
  2. Create tsconfig.json
  3. Create src/index.ts - the main library
  4. Create src/cli.ts - the CLI interface
  5. Update SKILL.md to reflect the TypeScript implementation
  6. Delete the old reminders.py

  Let me also look at the calendar skill for patterns on date handling and the e
  mail skill for general patterns.
• Let me check the calendar skill structure as a reference for date handling and
  patterns:
• Used ReadFile (skills/calendar/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/calendar/src/cli.ts)
• Hmm, the Python script for reminders is operational, but shifting to TypeScrip
  t provides better type safety and aligns with the project structure. I need to
  design a robust system that handles both one-off and recurring reminders. But
  wait, before I dive into the source code, I must set up the environment. I nee
  d a package.json for dependencies and a tsconfig.json for the build setup. Act
  ually, I should generate the .gitignore now too to avoid tracking build artifa
  cts later. Unless I establish this structure first, the implementation will be
  disorganized. I'll start by creating these three configuration files to define
  the skill's foundation and ensure the TypeScript project is valid.
• Now I have a good understanding of the patterns. Let me create the TypeScript
  implementation of the reminders skill. I'll need to:

  1. Create package.json
  2. Create tsconfig.json
  3. Create .gitignore
  4. Create src/index.ts (the main library)
  5. Create src/cli.ts (CLI interface)
  6. Update SKILL.md
  7. Delete the old Python files
• Used WriteFile (skills/reminders/package.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/reminders/tsconfig.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/reminders/.gitignore)
• Now let me create the main source files. I'll create the src/index.ts with the
  RemindersSkill class and src/cli.ts with the CLI.
• Now let me create the main TypeScript source files:
• Used WriteFile (skills/reminders/src/index.ts)
  Parent directory not found
• I need to create the src directory first.
• Used Shell (mkdir -p skills/reminders/src)
• Now let me create the source files.
• Used WriteFile (skills/reminders/src/index.ts)
• Now I need to create the CLI file. Let me create a comprehensive CLI that foll
  ows the patterns from the calendar skill.
• Used WriteFile (skills/reminders/src/cli.ts)
• Now I need to update the SKILL.md file to reflect the TypeScript implementatio
  n. Let me also delete the old Python file.
• Now let me update the SKILL.md and remove the old Python file:
• Used Shell (rm skills/reminders/reminders.py)
• Used WriteFile (skills/reminders/SKILL.md)
• Now I need to install dependencies and run typecheck to make sure everything p
  asses.
• Now let me install dependencies and run typecheck:
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && npm install 2>&1)
• The dependencies are installed (the warnings about deprecation and vulnerabili
  ties are from the sqlite3 dependency chain, not from our code). Now let me run
  typecheck.
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && npm run typecheck 2>&1)
  Failed with exit code: 2
• I need to fix a few TypeScript errors:

  1. In src/cli.ts, line 110, I need to fix the type check for ReminderType
  2. In src/index.ts, I need to properly type the lastID and changes properties
     ch come from the RunResult, not Database

  Let me fix these issues.
• Let me fix the TypeScript errors:
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/reminders/src/cli.ts)
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/reminders/src/index.ts)
• Now let me run typecheck again.
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Typecheck passes. Now let me build the project to make sure it compiles correc
  tly.
• Typecheck passes. Let me build and test the CLI:
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && npm run build 2>&1)
• The build succeeded. Now let me test the CLI to make sure it works.
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && no...e dist/cli.js health 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && no...s parse "in 2 hours" 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && no...t reminder from CLI" 2>&1)
• The basic health check and date parsing work as expected. Hmm, the creation ou
  tput shows ID: undefined. This is a clear indication that the return value of
  the database insertion isn't being captured correctly in the skill logic. Wait
  , I shouldn't just focus on the bug. I also need to verify the data persistenc
  e and other core functionalities like listing and recurring tasks. Actually, i
  nstead of just inspecting the source code again, I should test the CLI's workf
  low directly. If I list the reminders right now, I can confirm if the 'undefin
  ed' item was actually saved. Then, I'll try adding a recurring task and runnin
  g the stats command to ensure the database connection is stable across differe
  nt operations. Let me run a sequence of commands to verify the current state a
  nd the daemon's ability to retrieve tasks.
• The CLI works. The ID: undefined is just a display issue - let me test more co
  mmands and then fix that:
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && node dist/cli.js list 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && no...Test daily reminder" 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && node dist/cli.js stats 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && no...e dist/cli.js daemon 2>&1)
• Everything works! The ID is being stored correctly (we can see #1 in the list)
  , but there's a display issue in the CLI where result.lastID is not being retu
  rned properly. This is a known issue with sqlite3's TypeScript typings. The ac
  tual functionality works - the IDs are assigned. The issue is just in how we'r
  e extracting the lastID.

  Let me check the actual index.ts code and see if there's a way to fix this pro
  perly.

  Actually, the issue is that the run callback has this context for lastID, but
  we're not accessing it correctly. Let me trace through and see how the calenda
  r and email skills handle this pattern...

  Looking at those skills, they don't do INSERTs directly - they use the run() h
  elper we defined. But when you need the lastID, you need to use the callback p
  arameter or a different approach.

  Actually, I think the issue is that sqlite3's run() method is a bit tricky. Le
  t me look at a better way to handle this. One approach is to use the callback
  to capture this.lastID.

  Let me fix this properly:
• The functionality works (IDs are assigned correctly as shown by #1), but there
  's a display issue with extracting lastID. Let me fix this properly:
• Used ReadFile (skills/reminders/src/index.ts)
• Let me check the actual insert code and fix the lastID extraction. The issue i
  s that sqlite3 uses a callback with this context for lastID. I need to modify
  the approach.
• Used ReadFile (skills/reminders/src/index.ts)
• I see the issue. The sqlite3 module's run method returns the database instance
  , not the RunResult. The lastID is only available in the callback function's t
  his context. I need to use a different approach - I'll need to create a helper
  function that wraps the run and returns lastID from the callback.

  Let me fix this properly by modifying the approach to capture lastID.
• I need to fix the lastID extraction. The sqlite3 run() returns the database, n
  ot the RunResult. Let me fix this:
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/reminders/src/index.ts)
• Now let me update the addReminder and addRecurringReminder methods to use runW
  ithResult.
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/reminders/src/index.ts)
• Now let me rebuild and test again.
• Now let me rebuild and test:
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && np...other test reminder" 2>&1)
• Now the ID is showing correctly. Let me run all the quality checks and then co
  mmit the changes.
• Excellent! Now let me run full tests and typecheck:
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && node dist/cli.js list 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && no...st/cli.js complete 1 2>&1)
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && node dist/cli.js stats 2>&1)
• All the functionality works correctly. Let me now:1. Check if there are any gl
  obal quality checks to run2. Commit the changes3. Update the PRD4. Update prog
  ress.txtLet me first check if there's a root-level typecheck or test script.
• All functionality works. Let me check if there are any root-level quality chec
  ks:
• Used Shell (cat package.json 2>/dev/n...ho "No root package.json")
• Used Glob (*.json)
• There's no root package.json, so I'll just commit the changes. Let me:

  1. Add all the changes
  2. Commit with the message "feat: US-008 - Create reminders skill for task man
     ment"
  3. Update the PRD to set passes: true for US-008
  4. Append to progress.txt
• Now let me commit the changes:
• Used Shell (git status 2>&1)
• I see there are logs directory changes as well. Let me check what's in the log
  s to make sure I don't need to worry about them. Actually, I should only commi
  t the skill-related changes. Let me add the relevant files.
• Used Shell (git add skills/reminders/ && git status 2>&1)
• The skills/reminders changes are staged. Now let me commit and then update the
  PRD and progress.txt.
• Used Shell (git commit -m "feat: US-0...for task management" 2>&1)
• Now I need to update the PRD to set passes: true for US-008 and append the pro
  gress to progress.txt.
• Now let me update the PRD and progress.txt:
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
• Now let me append the progress to progress.txt.
• Used WriteFile (progress.txt)
• Now let me check if there are any AGENTS.md files that should be updated. Let
  me check if there's one in the skills/reminders directory or the root.
• Let me check if there are any AGENTS.md files to update:
• Used Glob (**/AGENTS.md)
  Unsafe pattern
• There's no AGENTS.md file in the root or skills directory. The progress.txt al
  ready has the Codebase Patterns section at the top. I've completed the story.
  Let me verify everything is committed and updated.
• Let me verify the changes and check the next story:
• Used Shell (cd skills/reminders && np..."✓ Typecheck passed" 2>&1)
• Used Grep ("passes": false)
• US-008 is complete. The next story with passes: false is US-009 (Create meetin
  gs skill for scheduling coordination), which depends on email and calendar ski
  lls.

  Let me summarize what was accomplished.
• I have successfully completed US-008 - Create reminders skill for task managem
  ent. Here's a summary:

  Completed Work

  Story US-008: Reminders Skill

  • TypeScript implementation replacing the old Python version
  • Features implemented:
    • ✅ One-time reminders with datetime
    • ✅ Recurring reminders (daily, weekly, monthly)
    • ✅ Natural language parsing ('in 2 hours', 'tomorrow', '14:30')
    • ✅ Snooze functionality
    • ✅ Mark complete/delete
    • ✅ Daemon mode for checking due reminders
    • ✅ SQLite storage
    • ✅ Typecheck passes

  Files Created/Modified:

  • skills/reminders/package.json - Dependencies and scripts
  • skills/reminders/tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
  • skills/reminders/.gitignore - Git ignore rules
  • skills/reminders/SKILL.md - Updated documentation
  • skills/reminders/src/index.ts - Main library with RemindersSkill class
  • skills/reminders/src/cli.ts - CLI interface
  • Deleted old skills/reminders/reminders.py

  Key Pattern Discovered:

  For SQLite3 in TypeScript, the run() method returns the Database instance, not
  the RunResult. To get lastID after INSERT, you need a custom helper that captu
  res this.lastID from the callback:

  function runWithResult(db: sqlite3.Database, sql: string, params: any[]): Prom
  ise<{ lastID: number; changes: number }> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      db.run(sql, params, function(this: sqlite3.RunResult, err) {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve({ lastID: this.lastID, changes: this.changes });
      });
    });
  }

  The next story to implement is US-009 - Create meetings skill for scheduling c
  oordination (depends on email and calendar).
