│ **Docker/Container Management:**                                             │
│ - **NEVER** run `docker stop` without an explicit container name or ID       │
│ - **NEVER** use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` or any pattern that stops mult │
│ iple/all containers                                                          │

│ **Process Management:**                                                      │
│ - **NEVER** run `killall`, `pkill`, or similar commands without specific pro │

│ **Port/Network Conflicts:**                                                  │
│ - If a port is in use, **USE A DIFFERENT PORT** instead of killing the proce │
│ ss using it                                                                  │
│ - Check what's running on a port with `lsof -i :<port>` or `ss -tlnp | grep  │
│ <port>`                                                                      │

│ ## Your Task                                                                 │

│ 1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)           │
│ 2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section  │
│ first)                                                                       │
│ 3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check i │
│ t out or create from main.                                                   │
│ 4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`            │
│ 5. Implement that single user story                                          │
│ 6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your proje │
│ ct requires)                                                                 │
│ 7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)      │
│ 8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Sto │
│ ry Title]`                                                                   │
│ 9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story              │
│ 10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`                                   │
│                                                                              │

│ APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):                       │
│ ```                                                                          │
│ ## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]                                                  │

│ - **Learnings for future iterations:**                                       │
│   - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")                 │
│   - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")   │
│   - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")          │

│ The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeati │
│ ng mistakes and understand the codebase better.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Consolidate Patterns                                                      │

│ If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, a │
│ dd it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (crea │
│ te it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most importa │
│ nt learnings:                                                                │

│ ## Codebase Patterns                                                         │
│ - Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations                       │
│ - Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations                         │
│ - Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components                    │
│ ```                                                                          │
│                                                                              │
│ Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific deta │
│ ils.                                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Update AGENTS.md Files                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving │
│ in nearby AGENTS.md files:                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories yo │
│ u modified                                                                   │
│ 2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directorie │
│ s or parent directories                                                      │
│ 3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developer │
│ s/agents should know:                                                        │
│    - API patterns or conventions specific to that module                     │
│    - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements                                     │
│    - Dependencies between files                                              │
│    - Testing approaches for that area                                        │
│    - Configuration or environment requirements                               │
│                                                                              │
│ **Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**                                    │
│ - "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"                     │
│ - "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"                             │
│ - "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"                        │
│ - "Field names must match the template exactly"                              │
│                                                                              │
│ **Do NOT add:**                                                              │
│ - Story-specific implementation details                                      │
│ - Temporary debugging notes                                                  │
│ - Information already in progress.txt                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that woul │
│ d help future work in that directory.                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Quality Requirements                                                      │
│                                                                              │
│ - ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test │
│ )                                                                            │
│ - Do NOT commit broken code                                                  │
│ - Keep changes focused and minimal                                           │
│ - Follow existing code patterns                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)                           │
│                                                                              │
│ For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:      │
│                                                                              │
│ 1. Load the `dev-browser` skill                                              │
│ 2. Navigate to the relevant page                                             │
│ 3. Verify the UI changes work as expected                                    │
│ 4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log                         │
│                                                                              │
│ A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.          │
│                                                                              │
│ ## Stop Condition                                                            │
│                                                                              │
│ After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.     │

• Let me start by reading the PRD file and the progress log to understand what n
  eeds to be done.
• Used ReadFile (prd.json)
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Let me continue reading the progress.txt file to get the full picture of what'
  s been done and what the codebase patterns are.
• Used ReadFile (progress.txt)
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && git branch -a)
• I have successfully reviewed the project state. The PRD outlines a total of 60
  user stories, and the progress.txt file confirms that the first 24 (US-001 thr
  ough US-024) are already implemented and have passes: true. I am currently on
  the ralph/all-skills branch, which is the correct context for this work.

  The next logical step in the sequence is US-025: Create hashtag-research skill
  for trending tags. The requirements for this story are quite specific: it need
  s to provide keyword-based suggestions, analyze trending topics, perform relev
  ance scoring, and handle niche discovery. A key constraint mentioned in the PR
  D is that this skill relies on web scraping rather than external APIs, which m
  eans I'll need to build a robust local data aggregation system.

  Hmm, before I dive into the implementation of the SQLite schema or the scrapin
  g logic, I need to ensure that the new skill adheres to the architectural patt
  erns established by the previous 24 skills. The SKILL.md file in the root of t
  he repository typically serves as the blueprint for these implementations. It
  should contain the standard interface definitions, expected method signatures,
  and perhaps specific guidelines on how to handle data caching or CLI integrati
  on.

  Actually, looking at the complexity of US-025, I'll likely need to implement a
  local cache to store the scraped hashtag data and trending information to avoi
  d redundant network calls. The SKILL.md should provide guidance on how the SQL
  ite storage is managed across the project.

  Wait, I should also verify if there are any shared utilities or base classes d
  efined in the examples that I should be inheriting from or utilizing. The exam
  ples/ directory might have templates for similar data-heavy skills.

  Therefore, my immediate priority is to examine the project's internal guidelin
  es and existing skill structures. I will read the main skill documentation and
  then list the contents of the skills/ and examples/ directories to orient myse
  lf within the codebase before I start scaffolding the new hashtag-research ski
  ll.
• I'm on the correct branch ralph/all-skills. Looking at the PRD, I can see that
  US-001 through US-024 are complete (passes: true). The next story to implement
  is US-025: Create hashtag-research skill for trending tags.

  Let me first check the existing skill structure to understand the patterns:
• Used ReadFile (SKILL.md)
• Used Glob (skills/*)
• Used Glob (examples/*)
• Let me look at one of the simpler skills that was recently created to understa
  nd the patterns better. I'll look at the content-writer skill or image-prompts
  skill as they seem similar in complexity to what I need to build.
• Let me look at a recent skill implementation to understand the patterns:
• Used ReadFile (skills/image-prompts/package.json)
• Used ReadFile (skills/image-prompts/tsconfig.json)
• Used ReadFile (skills/image-prompts/src/index.ts)
• I have a good understanding of the project structure and the patterns establis
  hed in previous skills like image-prompts and content-writer. The task for US-
  025 is to create the hashtag-research skill, which involves keyword-based sugg
  estions, trending analysis, relevance scoring, and niche discovery.

  Hmm, looking at the requirements, this skill doesn't require external API keys
  but will instead rely on web scraping and data aggregation. To implement this
  effectively, I'll need a robust local storage mechanism for caching trending t
  opics and historical data. SQLite is the clear choice here for managing the da
  ta efficiently without adding unnecessary overhead.

  Wait, before I dive into the implementation, I need to consider the user inter
  face. A CLI will be necessary for users to query hashtags and view reports. I'
  ll structure the project with a standard Node.js environment, ensuring I inclu
  de sqlite3 for data persistence and typescript for type safety, following the
  patterns seen in the other skill implementations.

  Actually, the first step isn't writing the logic, but setting up the foundatio
  nal files. I need to define the project metadata, dependencies, and the TypeSc
  ript configuration. Since this is a standalone skill, I'll create a new direct
  ory structure with package.json to manage the environment and tsconfig.json fo
  r the build process. This will allow me to then move on to the more complex ta
  sks of building the scraper and the CLI interface.

  I'll start by creating the directory and these essential configuration files t
  o establish the project's baseline.
• Now I understand the patterns. Let me create the hashtag-research skill (US-02
  5). This skill will help find relevant and trending hashtags for social media
  content.
• Used Shell (mkdir -p /root/code/skill...ills/hashtag-research/src)
• Now let me create the files for the hashtag-research skill.
• Used WriteFile (skills/hashtag-research/package.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/hashtag-research/tsconfig.json)
• Used WriteFile (skills/hashtag-research/.gitignore)
• Now let me create the main index.ts file with the HashtagResearchSkill class.
  This will be a comprehensive implementation with:

  1. SQLite storage for hashtag data
  2. Keyword-based hashtag suggestions
  3. Trending analysis
  4. Relevance scoring
  5. Niche discovery
  6. Caching mechanism
• Now let me create the main implementation file:
• Used WriteFile (skills/hashtag-research/src/index.ts)
• Now let me create the CLI file for the hashtag-research skill.
• Now let me create the CLI:
• Used WriteFile (skills/hashtag-research/src/cli.ts)
• Now let me create the SKILL.md documentation file for the hashtag-research ski
  ll.
• Now let me create the SKILL.md documentation:
• Used WriteFile (skills/hashtag-research/SKILL.md)
• Now let me install dependencies and run typecheck to make sure everything comp
  iles correctly.
• Now let me install dependencies and run typecheck:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...earch && npm install 2>&1)
• Good, npm install completed. Now let me run the typecheck.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
  Failed with exit code: 2
• There are a couple of type errors. Let me fix them:

  1. Line 197: Duplicate property in object literal
  2. Line 318: Index signature issue

  Let me read the file around those lines to see the issues.
• Let me fix the type errors:
• Used ReadFile (skills/hashtag-research/src/index.ts)
• Used ReadFile (skills/hashtag-research/src/index.ts)
• I see the issues:

  1. Line 197 has duplicate fitness key - it appears both in line 193 and line 1
  2. Line 318 - TypeScript is complaining about the competition multiplier index
     .

  Let me fix these issues.
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/hashtag-research/src/index.ts)
• Now let me run typecheck again.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Typecheck passes. Now let me build and test the CLI.
• Typecheck passes. Now let me build and test the skill:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...rch && npm run build 2>&1)
• Build succeeded. Let me test the CLI with a few commands to make sure everythi
  ng works.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...pm run cli -- health 2>&1)
• Hmm, the health check shows only 1 hashtag, which means the seed data wasn't i
  nserted properly. Let me check the database and debug.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...npm run cli -- stats 2>&1)
• There's a timing issue with the seeding. The prepared statement runs asynchron
  ously but we're not awaiting the results. Let me fix the seedDefaultHashtags m
  ethod to properly handle the async operations.
• I see the seeding has a timing issue. Let me fix the seedDefaultHashtags metho
  d:
• Used ReadFile (skills/hashtag-research/src/index.ts)
• I see the seeding uses a prepared statement but doesn't await the individual r
  uns. Let me rewrite the seedDefaultHashtags method to properly insert all reco
  rds.
• Used StrReplaceFile (skills/hashtag-research/src/index.ts)
• Now let me rebuild and test again.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...npm run cli -- stats 2>&1)
• Now we have 55 hashtags seeded correctly. Let me test a few more CLI commands
  to make sure everything works properly.
• Excellent! Now let me test a few more commands:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...t -p instagram -l 15 2>&1)
• The research command is working. Let me test the suggest command and niche dis
  covery.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...p!" -p twitter -l 10 2>&1)
• The suggest command is working. Let me test a few more commands and then commi
  t.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...ending -c tech -l 10 2>&1)
• Everything is working. Let me also test the niche discovery command and then c
  heck the typecheck again to make sure everything is good.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...-max-competition low 2>&1)
• No results for "vegan recipes" niche search, which is expected because we don'
  t have hashtags explicitly tagged with "vegan recipes" in our database. Let me
  try with food category to see if it returns results.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...-max-competition low 2>&1)
• Let me check if we have any low competition hashtags in the food category.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...ood -l 30 2>&1 | head -30)
• I see - all the food hashtags are medium or high competition in our default da
  ta. The niche discovery is working correctly - it's just that our seed data do
  esn't have low competition food hashtags. Let me add a few more low competitio
  n hashtags to the default data and also check the typecheck is still passing.

  Actually, let me just verify everything works and run typecheck one more time,
  then commit.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills/skil...&& npm run typecheck 2>&1)
• Typecheck passes. Now let me commit the changes. First, let me update the PRD
  to mark US-025 as complete, then commit all changes, and finally update the pr
  ogress.txt.
• All tests pass. Now let me commit the changes:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && git add -A && git status)
• Now let me update the PRD to mark US-025 as complete (passes: true), then comm
  it with the proper message, and update progress.txt.
• Used StrReplaceFile (prd.json)
• Now let me commit the changes with the proper message.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...l for trending tags" 2>&1)
• Now let me append the progress to the progress.txt file.
• Now let me append the progress to progress.txt:
• Used WriteFile (progress.txt)
• I have successfully completed the implementation of US-025 for the hashtag-res
  earch skill. Let me verify the current state of the repository to ensure all c
  hanges are correctly captured.

  First, I need to confirm that the progress.txt file has been properly updated
  with the details of this user story. This serves as the primary record of work
  done, so it's vital that my entry for US-025, including the implementation det
  ails and any blockers encountered, is accurately recorded.

  Hmm... I should also double-check the prd.json file. While I've been updating
  the progress log, the PRD might contain specific acceptance criteria or status
  flags that need to be synchronized with the actual implementation state. If th
  e PRD isn't updated, the project state remains inconsistent even if the code i
  s deployed.

  Wait, I also want to make sure that my commit from earlier actually included t
  he progress.txt changes. If I updated the log after the commit, the remote bra
  nch would be out of sync with my local tracking. Checking git status will imme
  diately reveal if there are any pending changes or untracked files that I miss
  ed.

  Actually, a quick look at the git log will confirm that the commit message for
  US-025 is present and correctly formatted. This audit step is crucial to ensur
  e that the repository is in a clean state and that US-025 is officially marked
  as complete across all documentation and tracking files. I will now run the ne
  cessary commands to inspect the progress log, the PRD, and the git state.
• Let me verify the progress file was updated and commit the progress update:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && t... echo "---" && git status)
• I need to also commit the progress.txt update. Let me do that now.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...progress for US-025" 2>&1)
• The hashtag-research skill is complete. Let me check if there are more stories
  to complete by looking at the PRD for any stories with passes: false.
• Let me check if there are more stories to complete:
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...: false' prd.json | wc -l)
• There are still 35 stories with passes: false. Let me check which is the next
  one with the highest priority.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...:|"priority":' | head -20)
• The next story is US-026 with priority 26. Let me check the details of that st
  ory.
• Used Shell (cd /root/code/skills && g...'"id": "US-026"' prd.json)
• I have successfully completed US-025: Create hashtag-research skill for trendi
  ng tags.
