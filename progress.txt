  - skills/quickbooks-auth/SKILL.md
  - skills/quickbooks-auth/src/index.ts
  - skills/quickbooks-auth/src/cli.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - QuickBooks OAuth requires realmId to be captured from the callback URL and passed to completeAuth()
  - Realm ID is stored in metadata during completeAuth: `this.auth.completeAuth('quickbooks', code, state, { realmId, environment })`
  - Use `realmId || undefined` when returning to satisfy TypeScript's string | undefined type
  - QuickBooks API endpoints require both access token AND realmId in the URL path
  - getApiBaseUrl() returns different URLs for sandbox vs production

## Codebase Patterns
- Skills are TypeScript-based with `SKILL.md` documentation in frontmatter format
- Use `src/` directory for TypeScript source files
- Use `sqlite3` package (not better-sqlite3) for SQLite - better compatibility
- **sqlite3 import**: Use `import * as sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'` (not default import)
- Encrypt sensitive data with `crypto-js` AES
- Store credentials in `~/.openclaw/skills/{skill-name}/`
- Use environment variables for OAuth client credentials
- Provider adapters implement base interface for OAuth flows
- PKCE is used for all OAuth flows for security
- Multi-profile support via (provider, profile) unique key
- Skills that depend on other skills should use `"@openclaw/auth-provider": "file:../auth-provider"` in package.json
- When extending auth-provider interfaces, export new types (UserProfile) from types.ts
- Async methods in AuthProvider require await when called from dependent skills
- **Race condition prevention**: If using async initialization (like SQLite), ensure `close()` waits for init to complete before cleaning up resources

  - Slack tokens don't expire (no refresh needed), but we still validate via auth.test
  - Slack API returns `{ ok: boolean, error?: string }` format for all responses
  - AuthUrlResult type from auth-provider doesn't include scopes - must track separately if needed
  - Use `isConnected()` with await since it's async (checks credentials from storage)
  - Slack OAuth v2 returns both bot token and user token - we use the bot token

  - sqlite3 module doesn't have a default export - use `import * as sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'`
  - Always wait for database initialization before closing to avoid race conditions
  - Use `new sqlite3.Database(path, callback)` pattern with Promise wrapper for async/await
  - When using `enableCache` with async initialization, ensure `close()` waits for initPromise
  - Gmail API returns base64url encoded data for attachments
  - Email threads use the same threadId across all messages in the conversation
  - Gmail API uses `users/me/messages` endpoint with OAuth authentication
  - The `run()` promisified helper must check if db is null before calling db.run()
## Codebase Patterns
- Skills are TypeScript-based with `SKILL.md` documentation in frontmatter format
- Use `src/` directory for TypeScript source files
- Use `sqlite3` package (not better-sqlite3) for SQLite - better compatibility
- **sqlite3 import**: Use `import * as sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'` (not default import)

- Async methods in AuthProvider require await when called from dependent skills
- **Race condition prevention**: If using async initialization (like SQLite), ensure `close()` waits for init to complete before cleaning up resources
- **SQLite run result**: To get `lastID` after INSERT, use a custom promisified wrapper that captures `this.lastID` from the callback:
  ```typescript
  function runWithResult(db: sqlite3.Database, sql: string, params: any[] = []): Promise<{ lastID: number; changes: number }> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      db.run(sql, params, function(this: sqlite3.RunResult, err: Error | null) {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve({ lastID: this.lastID, changes: this.changes });
      });
    });
  }

## Codebase Patterns
- Skills are TypeScript-based with `SKILL.md` documentation in frontmatter format
- Use `src/` directory for TypeScript source files
- Use `sqlite3` package (not better-sqlite3) for SQLite - better compatibility
- **sqlite3 import**: Use `import * as sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'` (not default import)
- Encrypt sensitive data with `crypto-js` AES
- Store credentials in `~/.openclaw/skills/{skill-name}/`
- Use environment variables for OAuth client credentials
- Provider adapters implement base interface for OAuth flows
- PKCE is used for all OAuth flows for security
- Multi-profile support via (provider, profile) unique key
- Skills that depend on other skills should use `"@openclaw/auth-provider": "file:../auth-provider"` in package.json
- When extending auth-provider interfaces, export new types (UserProfile) from types.ts
- Async methods in AuthProvider require await when called from dependent skills
- **Race condition prevention**: If using async initialization (like SQLite), ensure `close()` waits for init to complete before cleaning up resources
- **Dynamic imports for ES modules**: When a dependency skill uses ES modules (type: module), use dynamic import() with async/await instead of static import

## Codebase Patterns
- Skills are TypeScript-based with `SKILL.md` documentation in frontmatter format
- Use `src/` directory for TypeScript source files
- Use `sqlite3` package (not better-sqlite3) for SQLite - better compatibility
- **sqlite3 import**: Use `import * as sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'` (not default import)
- Encrypt sensitive data with `crypto-js` AES
- Store credentials in `~/.openclaw/skills/{skill-name}/`
- Use environment variables for OAuth client credentials
- Provider adapters implement base interface for OAuth flows
- PKCE is used for all OAuth flows for security
- Multi-profile support via (provider, profile) unique key
- Skills that depend on other skills should use `"@openclaw/auth-provider": "file:../auth-provider"` in package.json
- When extending auth-provider interfaces, export new types (UserProfile) from types.ts
- Async methods in AuthProvider require await when called from dependent skills
- **Race condition prevention**: If using async initialization (like SQLite), ensure `close()` waits for init to complete before cleaning up resources
- **SQLite run result**: To get `lastID` after INSERT, use a custom promisified wrapper that captures `this.lastID` from the callback:
  ```typescript
  function runWithResult(db: sqlite3.Database, sql: string, params: any[] = []): Promise<{ lastID: number; changes: number }> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      db.run(sql, params, function(this: sqlite3.RunResult, err: Error | null) {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve({ lastID: this.lastID, changes: this.changes });
      });
    });
  }
  ```
- **Dynamic imports for ES modules**: When a dependency skill uses ES modules (type: module), use dynamic import() with async/await instead of static import
- **Database column naming**: SQLite returns snake_case column names. Create separate Record interfaces (snake_case) and convert to main interfaces (camelCase):
  ```typescript
  interface InvoiceRecord {
    id?: number;
    invoice_number: string;
    // ... snake_case columns
  }
  // Convert when fetching:
  return {
    id: record.id,
    invoiceNumber: record.invoice_number,
    // ...
  };
  ```

  - Template variable substitution uses regex: `replace(/\{\{(\w+)\}\}/g, ...)`
  - JSON arrays in SQLite are stored as strings and parsed with `JSON.parse()` when retrieved
  - Use dynamic imports for ES module skills: `const { EmailSkill } = await import('@openclaw/email')`
  - The `daysBeforeDue` and `daysAfterDue` arrays define when reminders trigger
  - Stage progression: pre_due → on_due → post_due → final based on days relative to due date

---

## Codebase Patterns
- Skills are TypeScript-based with `SKILL.md` documentation in frontmatter format
- Use `src/` directory for TypeScript source files
- Use `sqlite3` package (not better-sqlite3) for SQLite - better compatibility
- **sqlite3 import**: Use `import * as sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'` (not default import)
- Encrypt sensitive data with `crypto-js` AES
- Store credentials in `~/.openclaw/skills/{skill-name}/`
- Use environment variables for OAuth client credentials
- Provider adapters implement base interface for OAuth flows
- PKCE is used for all OAuth flows for security
- Multi-profile support via (provider, profile) unique key
- Skills that depend on other skills should use `"@openclaw/auth-provider": "file:../auth-provider"` in package.json
- When extending auth-provider interfaces, export new types (UserProfile) from types.ts
- Async methods in AuthProvider require await when called from dependent skills
- **Race condition prevention**: If using async initialization (like SQLite), ensure `close()` waits for init to complete before cleaning up resources
- **SQLite run result**: To get `lastID` after INSERT, use a custom promisified wrapper that captures `this.lastID` from the callback:
  ```typescript
  function runWithResult(db: sqlite3.Database, sql: string, params: any[] = []): Promise<{ lastID: number; changes: number }> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      db.run(sql, params, function(this: sqlite3.RunResult, err: Error | null) {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve({ lastID: this.lastID, changes: this.changes });
      });
    });
  }
  ```
- **Dynamic imports for ES modules**: When a dependency skill uses ES modules (type: module), use dynamic import() with async/await instead of static import
- **Database column naming**: SQLite returns snake_case column names. Create separate Record interfaces (snake_case) and convert to main interfaces (camelCase):
  ```typescript
  interface InvoiceRecord {
    id?: number;
    invoice_number: string;
    // ... snake_case columns
  }
  // Convert when fetching:
  return {
    id: record.id,
    invoiceNumber: record.invoice_number,
    // ...
  };
  ```
- **Seeding data**: When seeding default data, use `runWithResult()` in a loop with await instead of prepared statements for proper async handling

## Codebase Patterns
- Skills are TypeScript-based with `SKILL.md` documentation in frontmatter format
- Use `src/` directory for TypeScript source files
- Use `sqlite3` package (not better-sqlite3) for SQLite - better compatibility
- **sqlite3 import**: Use `import * as sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'` (not default import)
- Encrypt sensitive data with `crypto-js` AES
- Store credentials in `~/.openclaw/skills/{skill-name}/`
- Use environment variables for OAuth client credentials
- Provider adapters implement base interface for OAuth flows
- PKCE is used for all OAuth flows for security
- Multi-profile support via (provider, profile) unique key
- Skills that depend on other skills should use `"@openclaw/auth-provider": "file:../auth-provider"` in package.json
- When extending auth-provider interfaces, export new types (UserProfile) from types.ts
- Async methods in AuthProvider require await when called from dependent skills
- **Race condition prevention**: If using async initialization (like SQLite), ensure `close()` waits for init to complete before cleaning up resources
- **SQLite run result**: To get `lastID` after INSERT, use a custom promisified wrapper that captures `this.lastID` from the callback:
  ```typescript
  function runWithResult(db: sqlite3.Database, sql: string, params: any[] = []): Promise<{ lastID: number; changes: number }> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      db.run(sql, params, function(this: sqlite3.RunResult, err: Error | null) {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve({ lastID: this.lastID, changes: this.changes });
      });
    });
  }
  ```
- **Dynamic imports for ES modules**: When a dependency skill uses ES modules (type: module), use dynamic import() with async/await instead of static import
- **Database column naming**: SQLite returns snake_case column names. Create separate Record interfaces (snake_case) and convert to main interfaces (camelCase):
  ```typescript
  interface InvoiceRecord {
    id?: number;
    invoice_number: string;
    // ... snake_case columns
  }
  // Convert when fetching:
  return {
    id: record.id,
    invoiceNumber: record.invoice_number,
    // ...
  };
  ```
- **Seeding data**: When seeding default data, use `runWithResult()` in a loop with await instead of prepared statements for proper async handling

- Async methods in AuthProvider require await when called from dependent skills
- **Race condition prevention**: If using async initialization (like SQLite), ensure `close()` waits for init to complete before cleaning up resources

  ```
- **Seeding data**: When seeding default data, use `runWithResult()` in a loop with await instead of prepared statements for proper async handling
- **Unique constraints**: Add UNIQUE constraints on key fields (like keyword in rules tables) to prevent duplicate entries when seeding default data
